- Forms auto-stack on mobile for easy scrolling
- Drag & drop images work on touchscreens
- Actions (Save/Publish) are always accessible at the bottom

## 🎨 Image Guidelines

### Recommended Sizes:
- **Hero/Cover Images**: 1600px width minimum
- **Gallery Images**: 1200px width minimum
- **Format**: JPG or PNG (WEBP auto-generated)

### Best Practices:
1. **Always add alt text** (required for accessibility & SEO)
   - Good: "Portrait of bride in vintage lace gown at golden hour"
   - Bad: "IMG_1234" or blank
2. **Use hotspot** to set the focal point (especially for portraits)
